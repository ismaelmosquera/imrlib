After building, you'll see the imr-lib.jar file
in the lib folder. You must add it to your classpath.
To compile and run the examples, you don't need to have it in your classpath.
To build the library, just execute the build.bat file in this folder,
in case that you are using a MSWindows command line; just type:

build

If you are working under a Linux like shell, execute the build.sh script:

./build.sh

::ismael
