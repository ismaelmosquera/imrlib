This example is already compiled; you can just execute the 'run.bat' file
in case you are using a MSWindows command line or 'run.sh' if you are under 
a Linux like shell.

/*
* This example, actually, demonstrates several classes in the imr.media.audio package.
* The example shows how the Modulator and its subclasses:
* - AmplitudeModulator
* - FrequencyModulator
* - RingModulator
*
* work.
*
* The classes RawDataPlayer and RawDataStorage
* are also used in this example.
* The example runs with a GUI and is so intuitive.
* It allows you to test the modulators and, if you wish, save the result
* in an audio file.
* You can set all the parameters you need through the GUI application.
* Place the cursor over the different components to see a tooltip
* describing its purpose.
* Take in account that this GUI was builded in the darkness
* since the author of all this work is completely blind.
* We think that it can be useful for
* anyone interested in audio processing and topics related.
*

If you wish, you can rebuild this example using the 'build.bat' or 'build.sh'
files in the same way as in the case of running the application.
