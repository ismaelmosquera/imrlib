This example is already compiled; you can just execute the 'run.bat' file
in case you are using a MSWindows command line or 'run.sh' if you are under 
a Linux like shell.

The example demonstrates several classes. What it actually does is synthesize a fragment of the
Fur Elise song using a MusicalInstrument object. The musical piece is synthesized in, playback it and, finally, store
the result in 'fur_elise.wav' inside the bin folder.
The difference with the example in the test_musical_instrument folder
is that, in this case, we mix two tracks into just one.
That is, a trebble line track and a bass line track.
So, we also demonstrate the AudioMixer class.

If you wish, you can rebuild this example using the 'build.bat' or 'build.sh'
files in the same way as in the case of running the application.
