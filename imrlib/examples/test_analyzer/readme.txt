This example was made just to introduce how spectral analisis/synthesis work.
That is, we analyze an audio signal, do nothing with the resulting spectra and synthesize it again.
So, we eventually get the original signal since any spectrum is modified.
Please, pick up at the source code example 'TestAnalyzer.java' to better understand how analisis/synthesis work.

As in the rest of examples in the 'examples' folder, all is already compiled,
you have just to execute the 'run.sh' script if you are under a like Linux shell,
or 'run.bat' one if you are under a MSWindows command line.
As we said before, the example is already compiled but, if you wish, you can compile it again
by executing the 'build.sh' or 'run.bat' like in the execution case.

We are working on thinking in useful things to do with the spectra.
We hope to have more features soon.
