This example is already compiled; you can just execute the 'run.bat' file
in case you are using a MSWindows command line or 'run.sh' if you are under 
a Linux like shell.

The example demonstrates several classes. What it actually does is synthesize a fragment of the
Star Wars song using AM synthesis. The musical piece is synthesized in real time, playback it and, finally, store
the result in 'star_wars.wav' inside the bin folder.

If you wish, you can rebuild this example using the 'build.bat' or 'build.sh'
files in the same way as in the case of running the application.
