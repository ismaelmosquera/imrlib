This example demonstrates the functionallity of the SpectrumPlot class.
First, four spectrums are computed from pure sinusoidals oscillating at the following frequencies:

- 125 Hz
- 250 Hz
- 500 Hz
- 1000 Hz

You can visualize them through the 'Frequency' menu.
Notice that the frequency for each spectrum shifts to the right for higher frequencies
and to the left for lower frequencies.
