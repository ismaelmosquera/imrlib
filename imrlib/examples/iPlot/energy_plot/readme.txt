This example demonstrates the computation for an audio signal.
Here, you can know how to do and undo hopsize, select a window to smooth your spectral analysis,
and some more things.
When running the example, you will see a frame having two plots.
At the top, an audio signal drawing in blue color.
At the bottom, a plot drawn in red color showing the energy of the above audio signal.
Please, see the explanation comments in the example source code.

I devoted this example to my assistant dog Inuit, died the last August the 12th of 2025.
Actually, he is the best I have known until now.
