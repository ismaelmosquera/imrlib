This example demonstrates the SignalPlot class.
It also proves that the generated waves are correct:

- SawWave
- SineWave
- SquareWave
- TriangularWave

A few cicles for each of those waves are generated to clearly show its shapes.
The number of cicles for each wave is the same, since all of them 
were generated at the same amplitude, frequency and sample rate.

**** build and run ****

The example is already compiled. Following, there are some instructions:

To run the example type:

run

or

./run.sh

depending in what kind of shell you are.

Although the example is already compiled, you can rebuild it if you wish.

To build the example just type:

build

if you are using a MsWindows command line shell.
If you are under a Linux like shell, type:
