The example is already compiled. To run it, you can use the run.bat in case 
that you are working with a MSWindows command line or the run.sh script
if you are under a Linux like shell.
This example demonstrates the following classes:
- Envelope
- Oscillator
- RawDataPlayer
- RawDataStorage

What the example actually does is to play the C major
musical scale for the second octave. For this purpose,
an oscillator is used to generate the frequencies of the musical notes
in the scale then, applies an envelope to the data generated by the oscillator; after apply
the envelope, the data is played by a RawDataPlayer object and accumulated
by a RawDataStorage object to, finally, store the result
in a wave audio file ( out.wav ).

If you wish, you can rebuild the example using the build.bat or build.sh
files in the same fashion than in the case of running.
