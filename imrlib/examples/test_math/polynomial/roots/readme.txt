Polynomial roots

This example shows how to compute polynomial roots.
At this moment, finding polynomial roots is availabel for:
- first, second, third and 4th degree polynomials.
Since a simple polynomial like x^2 + 1 = 0 equation
has complex roots, we always return a complex number array as a result.
The Polynomial class, has overloaded methods to compute roots for any numeric type:
- Integer.
- Real.
- Complex.
This example demonstrates all of this.

Building the example:

Maybe the example is already build. Anyway, if you want to rebuild it do as follows:

To build the example just type:

build

if you are using a MsWindows command line shell.
If you are under a Linux like shell, type:

./build.sh

To run the example type:

run

or

./run.sh

depending in what kind of shell you are.
The output will be redirected to out.txt in the bin folder.
