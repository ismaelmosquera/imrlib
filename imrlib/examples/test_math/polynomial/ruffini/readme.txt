This example demonstrates the RuffiniRule class.
This class implements the Ruffini algorithm to perform the division P(x) / (x - a),
where P(X) is a polynomial of any degree an (x - a), is a binomial
with coefficients of any number type: Integer, Real and Complex.

Building the example:

Maybe the example is already build. Anyway, if you want to rebuild it do as follows:

To build the example just type:

build

if you are using a MsWindows command line shell.
If you are under a Linux like shell, type:

./build.sh

To run the example type:

run

or

./run.sh

depending in what kind of shell you are.
The output will be redirected to out.txt in the bin folder.
