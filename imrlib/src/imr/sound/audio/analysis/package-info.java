/**
* The imr.sound.audio.analysis package offers classes suitable to perform Fourier analysis
* <p>
* in order to get the frequency decomposition of a floating point vector signal.
* <p>
*There are classes to perform the analysis, compute FFT and IFFT ,
* <p>
* and a <code>Spectrum</code> class to keep the data resulting from the analysis.
* <p>
* The <code>SpectralAnalyzer</code> implements windowing automatically but, in order to manage 'hop size' there is the <code>FrameShifter</code> available.
* <p>
* There is also a spectrum list class to act as a container for spectral data.
