/**
* The matrix package provides classes to perform the most common operations applied to matrices and vectors.
* <p>
* In addition, also implements functionality to solve nxn linear systems, perform LU decomposition
* <p>
* and QR factorization.
* <p>
* Implemented skills to solve NxN linear systems:
* <ul>
* <li>Cramer's rule.</li>
* <li>Gaussian elimination.</li>
* <li>LU decomposition.</li>
* <li>QR factorization.</li>
* </ul>
*
* The QR factorization is implemented just for square matrices.
* <p>
* Eigen:
* <p>
* An Eigen is a pair eigenvalue/eigenvector.
* <p>
* Find the maximum Eigen using the Power Method.
* <p>
* Find the eigensystem for a square matrix using the QR Algorithm.
* <p>
* Perform Singular Value Decomposition for a MxN matrix.
* <p>
* The result of a SVD factorization is as follows:
* <p>
* <code>M = SDV^t</code>
* <p>
* were
* <ul>
* <li>U is an orthogonal matrix having the left singular vectors of M.</li>
* <li>Sigma is a diagonal matrix having the singular values of M.</li>
* <li>V is an orthogonal matrix having the right singular vectors of M.</li>
* </ul>
